### Running this code/website

1) **Clone the repo from here:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:footworkjs/skeleton-app.git
cd skeleton-app
```

2) **Acquire npm and bower (javascript) dependencies:**

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) installed in your environment, then run the following:

```bash
npm install && bower install
```

3) **Run the local webserver:** (if necessary)

If you are not running this on a pre-existing server which already has an HTTP provider (Apache, nginx, etc) then you will need to run the local webserver in order to view the application. First off, make sure you have [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) installed, then run:

```bash
gulp webserver
```

You can now access the site at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or whatever host you have it running on, this assumes localhost)
