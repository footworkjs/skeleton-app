This repository is meant to be used as a base/example starting point for a FootworkJS web application. It includes several things pre-scaffolded and setup, including:

* Uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) for frontend dependencies
* Uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for tasks
* Uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) + [text plugin](https://github.com/requirejs/text) (so Footwork can automatically load assets)
  * Includes r.js for optimization and includes example working build.js
* Uses phantomjs and expect for unit tests (tests located in /spec)
* Includes example viewModel, and component which are resolved and bootstrapped dynamically at run-time
* Includes Bootstrap3 via Bower

Files/directories of note:

* ```public/index.html``` - Main index HTML file
* ```public/scripts/main.js``` - Application main starting module
* ```public/scripts/app/assets.js``` - Footwork viewModel/component/etc asset registrations
* ```public/scripts/app/viewModel/ExampleViewModel.js``` - Example viewModel
* ```public/scripts/app/component/my-component``` - Example component
* ```public/scripts/require-config.js``` - RequireJS configuration

### Running this code/website

1) **Clone the repo from here:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:footworkjs/skeleton-app.git
cd skeleton-app
```

2) **Acquire npm and bower (javascript) dependencies:**

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) installed in your environment, then run the following:

```bash
npm install && bower install
```

3) **Run the local webserver:** (if necessary)

If you are not running this on a pre-existing server which already has an HTTP provider (Apache, nginx, etc) then you will need to run the local webserver in order to view the application. First off, make sure you have [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) installed, then run:

```bash
gulp webserver
```

You can now access the site at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or whatever host you have it running on, this assumes localhost)
